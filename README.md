> **Coding Philosophy**
>
> "Coding should be a fun intellectual creation rather than mechanical repetitive work. Business is the core, and technology is the foundation—both can be achieved simultaneously."
>
> I always adhere to the principle of **"Keep It Simple, Stupid"** and strive to solve problems in a concise and efficient manner.
>
> I pursue efficiency, not meaningless rat races.
